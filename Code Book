File include in this project:
- README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List 561 features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': There are 6 class labels link with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 
for more information including in README.txt and features_info.txt.

Data files that were not used
This analysis was performed using only the files above, and did not use the raw signal data. Therefore, the data files in the "Inertial Signals" folders were ignored.
